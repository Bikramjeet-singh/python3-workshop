## Basic Data Structures 

### Numbers

#### Types of numbers

Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals). We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.

Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.

| Examples         | Number Type            |
|------------------|------------------------|
| 1, 2, 100, -100  | Integer                |
| 1.2,-0.5,2e2,3E2 | Floating Point Numbers |

#### Basic Arithmetic

```
# Addition
2 + 1
> 3
```

```
# Subtraction
2 - 1
> 1
```
```
# Multiplication
2 * 2
> 4
```
```
# Division
3 / 2
> 1.5
```
```
# Floor Division
7 // 4
> 1
```

```
# Modulo
7 % 4
> 3
```

```
# Powers
2 ** 3
> 8
```

```
# Can use parentheses to specify orders
(2+10) * (10+3)
> 156
```

#### Object Assignment in Python

```
# Let's create an object called "x" and assign it the number 5
x = 5
```
